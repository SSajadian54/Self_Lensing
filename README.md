Here, there are some python-based codes which find the best-fitted model for the self-lensing signal detected in the TESS photometric data, and depict the corner 
plots, best-fitted models.  

There are two animations which show the stellar orbit around the compact object, and the images of the source star due to the self-lensing effect.

The Jupyter notebooks extract the TESS data using the "lightkurve" python-based package (developed for the Kepler and TESS data) and plot the periodogram 
for the source flux. 

If you have any problem for running the codes on your own computer, please contact me:  sedighe.sajadian@gmail.com
